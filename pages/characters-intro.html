Though, from the little data I could gather, this ain't no normal T-Doll. Her specs, modules and body are almost military grade in quality, whoever built this girl didn't skimp on a single cent.</p>

                    <p>Mark my words Commander, she's most definitely an experiment. Whatever's hiding under that sweet girl faÃ§ade is not normal. Whether it's a good thing or not though... well I'm not paid enough to risk my life to find out.</p>

                    <p>Oh yea and before you ask, yes those are polaroids. You see, I'm just a poor merc doing her job and I'm clearly not paid enough to buy a better camera so I make do with what I have... So if you want better quality you'll have to make some donations~</p>

                    <p>I should also mention this, she's among the very few survivors of the "Butterfly Incident"... for a simple T-Doll to able to survive such a disaster, she'd have to deal with the devil or be the toughest bastard on this side of the world.</p>

                    <p>Lightweight and cheap, the civilian's favorite. Goodness this girl takes her job seriously. Confident, strict and grumpy, she usually takes the role of the "straight man" in the team. There isn't a lot to remark about her other than the fact that she's the demolitions expert. So if I were you I wouldn't anger her haha~</p>

                    <p>Built to be an elite soldier, she despises M4A1 as a leader<span>no big surprise</span>and would rather jump in the battle by herself. She's a dangerous one, commander... I like her~</p>

                    <p>The SPEC-OPS go-to modification kit. Incredibly sadistic and resilient, she's the team's bruiser. I've seen her jump to the enemy lines and tear down dozens of dolls all by herself... You'd expect her to be disobedient but she will always listen to her team's members or commander's orders. She's like an attack dog, but like, super extra lethal.</p>

                    <p>I don't know whose idea was to give an elite T-doll the need to collect eyes and tear other dolls into pieces... I wonder whether it was intended or not.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact, taking this picture wasn't an easy task AT ALL. She's too fast, even for a T-Doll!</p>

                    <p>While peeking around databases and places I probably shouldn't be I found records mentioning a new member for AR team. I couldn't find a lot regarding this mysterious T-Doll other than her electronic warfare modules are top tier and something about her is "Next generation", don't know what though.</p>

                    <p>Lucky me, I did manage to get a picture just because I'm that awesome <span>also it's going to cost you extra</span>, she looks fairly unremarkable to me... other than the fact that she looks like a banana with that jacket.</p>

                                <p>The SPEC-OPS go-to modification kit. Incredibly sadistic and resilient, she's the team's bruiser. I've seen her jump to the enemy lines and tear down dozens of dolls all by herself... You'd expect her to be disobedient but she will always listen to her team's members or commander's orders. She's like an attack dog, but like, super extra lethal.</p>
            
                                <p>I don't know whose idea was to give an elite T-doll the need to collect eyes and tear other dolls into pieces...  I wonder whether it was intended or not.</p>

                                <p>While peeking around databases and places I probably shouldn't be I found records mentioning a new member for AR team. I couldn't find a lot regarding this mysterious T-Doll other than her electronic warfare modules are top tier and something about her is "Next generation", don't know what though.</p>
