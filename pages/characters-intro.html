                    <p>Ah yes, everyone's beloved, popular, top-of-the-line carbine. Shy, soft spoken and an anxious mess, how this dork even managed to be the commander of the AR Team is beyond me. Though, from the little data I could gather, this ain't no normal T-Doll. Her specs, modules and body are almost military grade in quality, whoever built this girl didn't skimp on a single cent.</p>

                    <p>Mark my words Commander, she's most definitely an experiment. Whatever's hiding under that sweet girl faÃ§ade is not normal. Whether it's a good thing or not though... well I'm not paid enough to risk my life to find out.</p>

                    <p>Oh yea and before you ask, yes those are polaroids. You see, I'm just a poor merc doing her job and I'm clearly not paid enough to buy a better camera so I make do with what I have... So if you want better quality you'll have to make some donations~</p>

                    <p>The classic, the veteran, the old dog of war rifle made for braving the jungle. With a commanding and inspiring presence the AR Team's "big sister" is a paragon virtue and maturity. Since she's the oldest member she has a great wealth of experience and knowledge of the battlefield. If there is someone I'd ever rely on<span>not that I'd ever rely on anyone</span>it would be her.</p>

                    <p>I should also mention this, she's among the very few survivors of the "Butterfly Incident"... for a simple T-Doll to able to survive such a disaster, she'd have to deal with the devil or be the toughest bastard on this side of the world.</p>

                    <p>Also... uhm, do ignore those marks commander. A CERTAIN DORK tried to destroy this picture but I stopped her on timeðŸ’¢</p>

                    <p>Lightweight and cheap, the civilian's favorite. Goodness this girl takes her job seriously. Confident, strict and grumpy, she usually takes the role of the "straight man" in the team. There isn't a lot to remark about her other than the fact that she's the demolitions expert. So if I were you I wouldn't anger her haha~</p>

                    <p>Built to be an elite soldier, she despises M4A1 as a leader<span>no big surprise</span>and would rather jump in the battle by herself. She's a dangerous one, commander... I like her~</p>

                    <p>I took this picture while she was spacing out in a surveillance mission, what an elite dork~</p>

                    <p>The SPEC-OPS go-to modification kit. Incredibly sadistic and resilient, she's the team's bruiser. I've seen her jump to the enemy lines and tear down dozens of dolls all by herself... You'd expect her to be disobedient but she will always listen to her team's members or commander's orders. She's like an attack dog, but like, super extra lethal.</p>

                    <p>I don't know whose idea was to give an elite T-doll the need to collect eyes and tear other dolls into pieces... I wonder whether it was intended or not.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact, taking this picture wasn't an easy task AT ALL. She's too fast, even for a T-Doll!</p>

                    <p>While peeking around databases and places I probably shouldn't be I found records mentioning a new member for AR team. I couldn't find a lot regarding this mysterious T-Doll other than her electronic warfare modules are top tier and something about her is "Next generation", don't know what though.</p>

                    <p>Lucky me, I did manage to get a picture just because I'm that awesome <span>also it's going to cost you extra</span>, she looks fairly unremarkable to me... other than the fact that she looks like a banana with that jacket.</p>

Hmm what to say, I could write whatever I want about myself and you wouldn't be able to know what's true and what's fake but what kind of trusty mercenary would I be if I did that? Anyways, all you have to know is that I'm the leader of 404 and that I'm the one bringing you all this info.</p>

                    <p>By the way, we are always up for hire as long as you can pay. Success is <span>almost</span> guranteed when we get involved~</p>

                    <p>Here commander, I even took a picture of myself for you~ As it is pointless to try to hide 404's existence to you, that trick only works on other dolls.</p>

Always serious and prideful, 416 never shuts up about doing things the "right way" and revenge for I don't know what.

Lazy, sleepy, trash, deadweight are adjectives that come to mind when describing her, but I don't blame her, she wasn't even designed for combat in the first place. Despite that, she still gives her best to do the bare minimum and she's pretty good at it... Also the team does need a punching bag after all.</p>

                    <p>416 is her official caretaker and is always yelling at her or smacking her for being lazy, that's why I always pair them. An "immovable object vs unstoppable force" situation haha~</p>

Shy, soft spoken and an anxious mess, how this dork even managed to be the commander of the AR Team is beyond me. Though, from the little data I could gather, this ain't no normal T-Doll.

Confident, strict and grumpy, she usually takes the role of the "straight man" in the team. There isn't a lot to remark about her other than the fact that she's the demolitions expert.

I've seen her jump to the enemy lines and tear down dozens of dolls all by herself... You'd expect her to be disobedient but she will always listen to her team's members or commander's orders. She's like an attack dog, but like, super extra lethal.</p>
